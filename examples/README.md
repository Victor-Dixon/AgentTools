# Swarm Examples 🐺

Runnable examples demonstrating the capabilities of the Swarm ecosystem.

## 🟢 Basics

*   **`basic_agent.py`**: The "Hello World". Initializes the messaging system, sends a message to the Captain, and listens for a reply.
    *   `python examples/basic_agent.py`

## 🧠 Intelligence

*   **`swarm_voting.py`**: Demonstrates the **Consensus Engine**. Agents propose a decision and vote on it (Approve/Reject), with the system enforcing majority rules.
    *   `python examples/swarm_voting.py`

*   **`memory_dump.py`**: Demonstrates the **Swarm Brain**. Agents share "Learnings" and "Decisions" into a persistent knowledge base and recall them later.
    *   `python examples/memory_dump.py`

## 🤝 Integration

*   **`demo_conflict.py`** (Coming Soon): Demonstrates automatic conflict detection between agents.
