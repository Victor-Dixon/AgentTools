Swarm MCP Toolbelt - Multi-Agent AI Coordination Framework
===========================================================

🐺 WE ARE SWARM - A pack of wolves, not bees.

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) toolbelt for coordinating a swarm of AI agents.
Like wolves hunting together - communicating, sharing knowledge, and 
coordinating attacks without human intervention.

"Alone we are strong. Together we are unstoppable."

Core Features:
    - PackCoordinator: Central orchestration for the swarm
    - MessageQueue: Agent-to-agent async messaging
    - PackMemory: Collective knowledge sharing

IP-Level Features:
    - ConsensusEngine: Multi-agent voting and decision making
    - ConflictDetector: Prevent duplicate work across agents
    - AgentDNA: Learn agent strengths over time
    - WorkProofSystem: Cryptographic proof of work completion
    - PatternMiner: Learn from successful coordination patterns

Quick Start:
    from swarm_mcp import PackCoordinator, ConsensusEngine, AgentDNA
    
    # Coordinate agents
    pack = PackCoordinator(wolves=["agent-1", "agent-2", "agent-3"])
    pack.assign_hunt("agent-1", "Fix the auth bug")
    
    # Make collective decisions
    consensus = ConsensusEngine()
    proposal = consensus.propose("agent-1", "Use PostgreSQL", "Need ACID...")
    consensus.vote(proposal.id, "agent-2", VoteType.APPROVE, "Agree")
    
    # Learn agent strengths
    dna = AgentDNA()
    best = dna.find_best_agent(category="debugging", files=["auth.py"])
