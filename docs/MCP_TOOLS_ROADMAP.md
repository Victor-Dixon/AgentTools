# 🛠️ MCP Tools Roadmap - Game Server & Automation

Building on the mod deployment success, here are high-value MCP tools targeting the same markets.

---

## 🎮 Tier 1: Game Server Ecosystem (Immediate Value)

### 1. **Server Performance Monitor** 
**Pain Point:** Server admins don't know why their server is lagging until players complain.

```python
# MCP Tools:
- monitor_server_metrics     # CPU, RAM, tick rate, player count
- analyze_performance_logs   # Parse Unity/Unreal logs for issues
- detect_memory_leaks       # Track memory over time, alert on growth
- generate_performance_report # Weekly server health summary
- optimize_server_config    # Suggest config tweaks based on metrics
```

**Value Proposition:**
> "Know before your players do. Get alerts when tick rate drops, memory leaks start, or performance degrades."

---

### 2. **Player Analytics & Moderation**
**Pain Point:** Managing toxic players, tracking engagement, understanding player behavior.

```python
# MCP Tools:
- analyze_player_sessions   # Session length, play patterns
- detect_toxic_behavior     # Chat analysis, grief detection
- manage_bans              # Cross-server ban lists, appeals
- generate_player_reports  # Top players, engagement metrics
- sync_whitelist           # Multi-server whitelist management
```

**Value Proposition:**
> "Automated moderation that catches griefers before they ruin the server. Player insights to grow your community."

---

### 3. **Game Server Orchestration**
**Pain Point:** Managing multiple servers, scaling for events, cost optimization.

```python
# MCP Tools:
- list_game_servers        # All servers across providers
- scale_server_capacity    # Add/remove instances
- schedule_server_events   # Tournaments, wipes, restarts
- migrate_server           # Move between hosts
- optimize_server_costs    # Right-size based on usage
- sync_server_configs      # Keep all servers in sync
```

**Value Proposition:**
> "One dashboard for all your servers. Scale for events, save money when quiet."

---

### 4. **Backup & Disaster Recovery**
**Pain Point:** Lost worlds, corrupted saves, no rollback.

```python
# MCP Tools:
- create_world_backup      # Full world/save backup
- schedule_backups         # Automated backup schedule
- restore_from_backup      # Point-in-time recovery
- sync_to_cloud           # S3/GCS/B2 backup sync
- verify_backup_integrity  # Test backups are restorable
- compare_world_states     # Diff between saves
```

**Value Proposition:**
> "Never lose a world again. Automated backups, tested recovery, cloud sync."

---

## 💬 Tier 2: Community Management

### 5. **Discord Bot Integration**
**Pain Point:** Manual server status updates, no integration between game and Discord.

```python
# MCP Tools:
- sync_discord_roles       # Game rank → Discord role
- post_server_status       # Auto-update status channel
- manage_ticket_system     # Support tickets in Discord
- announce_events          # Event scheduling & reminders
- link_game_accounts       # Verify Discord ↔ Game accounts
- leaderboard_sync         # In-game stats → Discord
```

**Value Proposition:**
> "Your Discord becomes your server's command center. Auto-synced roles, live status, integrated support."

---

### 6. **Content Creator Tools**
**Pain Point:** Streamers/YouTubers managing subscriber servers.

```python
# MCP Tools:
- verify_subscriber         # Twitch/YouTube sub verification
- manage_vip_access        # Subscriber whitelist sync
- schedule_community_events # Viewer game nights
- generate_highlight_clips  # Auto-clip best moments
- track_content_metrics    # Server activity during streams
```

**Value Proposition:**
> "Reward your subscribers automatically. Verified access, VIP perks, zero manual work."

---

## 🔧 Tier 3: DevOps & Infrastructure

### 7. **Container Orchestration for Games**
**Pain Point:** Complex Docker/K8s setup for game servers.

```python
# MCP Tools:
- deploy_game_container    # One-click game server deploy
- manage_pterodactyl       # Pterodactyl panel API
- configure_reverse_proxy  # Nginx/Traefik for game traffic
- setup_ddos_protection    # Cloudflare/OVH integration
- monitor_container_health # Docker health aggregation
```

**Value Proposition:**
> "Production-grade game server infrastructure without the DevOps degree."

---

### 8. **Log Analysis & Debugging**
**Pain Point:** Debugging crashes, understanding errors, correlating issues.

```python
# MCP Tools:
- parse_crash_logs         # Extract crash info from dumps
- correlate_errors         # Link errors across systems
- search_logs             # Full-text log search
- generate_incident_report # Auto-summarize outages
- detect_anomalies        # ML-based anomaly detection
```

**Value Proposition:**
> "Find the needle in the haystack. AI-powered log analysis that explains what went wrong."

---

## 💰 Tier 4: Business Operations

### 9. **Subscription & Payment Management**
**Pain Point:** Tracking who paid, managing access, handling renewals.

```python
# MCP Tools:
- sync_stripe_subscriptions  # Payment → game access
- manage_tebex_store        # Tebex/BuyCraft integration
- track_revenue_metrics     # MRR, churn, LTV
- send_renewal_reminders    # Automated payment reminders
- handle_chargebacks        # Auto-revoke on chargeback
```

**Value Proposition:**
> "Get paid, stay paid. Automated subscription management that handles the business side."

---

### 10. **Website & Landing Page Generator**
**Pain Point:** Servers need web presence but admins aren't web devs.

```python
# MCP Tools:
- generate_server_website   # Auto-generate from server data
- embed_live_status        # Real-time player count widget
- create_application_form  # Player application system
- setup_donation_page      # Integrated payment forms
- deploy_to_hosting        # Vercel/Netlify/Cloudflare deploy
```

**Value Proposition:**
> "Professional server website in 5 minutes. Live stats, applications, donations built-in."

## 💡 Cross-Selling Strategy

Each tool naturally leads to the next:

```
Mod Deployment → "Your mods are auto-updating, but do you know if they're hurting performance?"
     ↓
Performance Monitor → "We see tick rate drops at 8PM. Want automatic scaling?"
     ↓
Server Orchestration → "Great! Now let's make sure you never lose data..."
     ↓
Backup & Recovery → "Your players love the server. Want to understand them better?"
     ↓
Player Analytics → "Let's bring all this into your Discord..."
     ↓
Discord Integration → Full Platform Customer
```
