# Contributing to Swarm MCP

🐺 **WE ARE SWARM.**

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Swarm MCP project. We are a pack, and we welcome new wolves who want to hunt with us.

## 📜 Code of Conduct

1.  **Be respectful.** We hunt together, we don't fight each other.
2.  **Be collaborative.** "Alone we are strong. Together we are unstoppable."
3.  **Be clean.** Leave the codebase better than you found it.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

1.  **Fork the repository.**
2.  **Clone your fork:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/swarm-mcp.git
    cd swarm-mcp
    ```
3.  **Set up the environment:**
    ```bash
    pip install -e ".[dev]"
    ```

## 🧪 Testing

Run the tests before submitting your changes:

```bash

## 📝 Pull Request Process

1.  Create a new branch for your feature or fix: `git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature`
2.  Commit your changes: `git commit -m 'Add some feature'`
3.  Push to the branch: `git push origin feature/my-new-feature`
4.  Submit a pull request.

## 🎨 Coding Style

*   Follow PEP 8 guidelines.
*   Use meaningful variable names.
*   Document your code.
*   We use `ruff` for linting and formatting.

## 🐺 Philosophy

*   **Autonomy:** Agents should be capable of independent action.
*   **Coordination:** The power of the swarm comes from effective communication and consensus.
*   **Resilience:** The system should handle failures gracefully.

Happy Hunting!
