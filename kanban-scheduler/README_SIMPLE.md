# Kanban Scheduler - Super Simple Guide

## Just Run It! 🚀

```bash
npm start
```

That's it! The script will:
- ✅ Install everything automatically
- ✅ Set up the database
- ✅ Generate API keys
- ✅ Start both servers

## What You'll See

After running `npm start`, you'll see:

1. **Web App**: Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
2. **API for Agents**: http://YOUR_IP:5000/api/ai
3. **Your API Key**: Shown in the terminal (for agents on other computers)

## For Agents on Other Computers

The server automatically shows:
- Your computer's IP address
- The API key to use

Just copy those and use them from any other computer on your network!

## That's It!

No configuration needed. No setup. Just run `npm start` and you're good to go! 🎉
